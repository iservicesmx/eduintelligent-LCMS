Preeliminary setup
-------------------

Being a doctest, we can tell a story here. 

First, we must perform some setup. We use the testbrowser that is shipped
with Five, as this provides proper Zope 2 integration. Most of the 
documentation, though, is in the underlying zope.testbrower package.

    >>> from Products.Five.testbrowser import Browser
    >>> browser = Browser()
    >>> portal_url = self.portal.absolute_url()

The following is useful when writing and debugging testbrowser tests. It lets
us see all error messages in the error_log.

    >>> self.portal.error_log._ignored_exceptions = ()

With that in place, we can go to the portal front page and log in. We will
do this using the default user from PloneTestCase:

    >>> from Products.PloneTestCase.setup import portal_owner, default_password

    >>> browser.open(portal_url+'/login_form')

    >>> browser.getControl(name='__ac_name').value = portal_owner
    >>> browser.getControl(name='__ac_password').value = default_password
    
    >>> import pdb; pdb.set_trace()
    
    >>> browser.getControl(name='submit').click()

Here, we set the value of the fields on the login form and then simulate a
submit click.

Go back to the front page:

    >>> browser.open(portal_url)
    >>> browser.url == portal_url
    True

  jq somewhere in a plone < 3.1 ... it will be broken)

4.1.0 beta 2
############

* Copying/pasting an article preserves referenced files/images/links,
  using the new 'keepReferencesOnCopy' kw arg on ReferenceFields. Note
  this requires AT 1.5.9 +. This has no effect in older AT versions
  (read Plone 3.0.6 and older)
  [glenfant] 2008-04-22

* pa_model_macros.pt defined "file proxy/getFile | nothing" but didnt checked
  file for None later on in every case. Fixed that using a condition for the
  whole block.

* pa_browser.js fixed Browser.window call in Browser.size() caused by some
  more API incompatibilities.

  policy)
  [glenfant]

  image.
  [glenfant] 2008-02-27

* increased version number to '4.1.0-beta2 CVS/SVN (UNRELEASED)' to avoid
  confusion
  [rnix] 2008-02-21

* altered jquery with newer version 1.2.2 and first bugfixes in the pa_*.js
  files fitting new jquery API. disabled the pa_jquery.js in
  profiles/default/jsregistry.xml by default, since jquery gets de-facto
  standard in future, no need to load the own version any longer. this is why
  an uncompressen version is copied in there. also done documentation for this
  in README
  [rnix] 2008-02-21

* changed test_getIndexableValue in test_innercontentfield.py, line 451,
  expected_value did not fit file_values, assertEquals failed.
  Test ran on ubuntu, python2.4, there might be platform dependent
  implementations of the .split() function, maybe think about a more robust
  test implementation here. same in test_article.py, test_SearchableText,
  line 155.
  [rnix] 2008-02-21

* We show the size of the referenced files too. Note: the
  pa_models_macros is really ugly and unefficient and should be
  rewritten using a view.
  [glenfant]

* Initial max file and image sizes are taken from ATCT config if
  set. But these sizes may be tweaked independantly afterwards as
  usual.
  [glenfant]

* Fixed an infinite redirection when viewing a multipage PA with no
  TOC on default page and Plone navigation menu showig only the
  current level. Play the "Types tool" step of PloneArticle profile in
  the GenericSetup tool to install the fix.
  [glenfant]

* Fixed javascript errors in plone3.1 :
  Close the ticket : http://plone.org/products/plonearticle/issues/9

    (displayed only if plone version < 3.1)

    (2 differents patches for plone3.0.x or for plone3.1.x)

  (smaller + bg & border colors changed)
  You can always change the css values through browser/modelconfig.py

############

* Modified the image browser to display the arrows only when there is a
  previous/next image to display
  [macadames]

* Propertiestool.xml changed such that we add values in properties
  rather than replacing existing ones (e.g. removing standard "types
  not searched").
  [glenfant]

* Use plone.i18n url normalize to rename content from filenames. (see
  BaseObject.generateNewId)
  [bmathieu]

* For a very weird reaseon, the tool couldn't acquire the REQUEST when
  an image thumbnail is published. We must provide it explicitely from
  the "pa_thumb" traversal.
